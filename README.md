## **SHORT SUMMARY**
1. The Strategic Pivot to TV Shows
Netflix’s evolution from a movie-centric platform to a TV Show powerhouse is undeniable. Analysis of 8,800+ titles reveals TV Shows grew by 220% post-2015, surpassing Movies by 2020. This aligns with their focus on serialized content to boost subscriber retention and reduce churn. The data signals a clear winner: binge-worthy series are now the cornerstone of Netflix’s strategy, driving longer viewer engagement and recurring revenue.

2. Global Content, Local Stories
While the U.S. leads production (35% of titles), markets like India and South Korea are rising stars. India’s output surged by 150% post-2018, fueled by local hits like Sacred Games, while non-English content now comprises 40% of the library. This isn’t just diversification—it’s a deliberate play to dominate global streaming by investing in hyper-local narratives that resonate culturally, proving that great stories transcend borders.
